# Survey Project

I have created a "How are you?" survey. It basically asks general questions and calculate a score based on user's answers and suggests something to do in summary. I just wanted to add the weather app fetching in my project to try out new things within React. I will definately improve my project from this point.

## Getting Started with the Project

I planned it as a questionary and implemented prop drilling with the examples from youtube. I created different question components to display them in my survey, i created a basic json questions file to get questions from. then i builded it on top that base sstructure.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Prop drilling: I may overused it to achieve my goals. Next time with a beter planning i might be able use it less to not confuse myself and other developers.

### View it live
